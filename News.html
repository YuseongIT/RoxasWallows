                    <h3>Wallows Talks Second Album “Tell Me That It’s Over,” Touring the World, and Being in “Go-Mode”</h3>
                    <p>The trio, made up of Dylan Minnette, Braeden Lemasters, and Cole Preston, has been called every label under the sun. Alt-rock, electropop, garage-rock, power-pop. they've heard it all. And while alt-rock has seemed the most fitting for the band throughout most of their discography — 2018's EP Spring, 2019's debut album Nothing Happens, and 2020's quarantine-crafted EP Remote — now, Wallows is exploring exciting and experimental territory. And their sophomore album Tell Me That It's Over, released today (March 25), is a shining example of their sonic evolution. Stay tuned for more details!</p>

                <h3>The Best of Wallows… So Far</h3>
                <p>Wallows, the three-man alternative rock band based in Los Angeles, coats every song in post-punk rhythms that paint pretty pictures of nostalgia and lost innocence. Comprised of 13 Reasons Why actor Dylan Minnette, Braeden Lemasters, and Cole Preston, these childhood friends’ overnight success was ten years in the making, including many prerequisite hours.

                    Despite their being in alternative rock, the group has a niche for shaking things up. “We don’t have a particular musical style,” says Lemasters in a press release. “We incorporate whatever we happen to be listening to and are inspired by. It all depends on what the song requires.”

            <h3>Wallows Release New Single ‘I Don’t Want to Talk’</h3>
            <p>Wallows are back with a new video for “I Don’t Want to Talk.”

                This is the band’s first release since their Remote EP in February. Having worked for over a year on this track, Wallows stars in the warm, vintage-kissed video. The song sings of pushing a girl away and simultaneously pitying yourself: “I’m not alright / but I don’t need comfort / I don’t want to talk.” As the band takes part in random activities—reading fortune cookies, boxing, jump roping, singing to a mirror in a field—they attempt to avoid her seeping into their thoughts again, and they would rather have her “tell me that it’s over.” Stay tuned for more details!</p>
