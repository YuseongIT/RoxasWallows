                <p>As teenagers in 2011, Braeden Lemasters (guitar/vocals), Cole Preston (guitar/drums), and 
                    Dylan Minnette (guitar/vocals) formed the band at a music studio called Join the Band in 
                    Van Nuys with Zack Mendenhall (bass). They were students enrolled in the GigMasterz program 
                    at Keyboard Galleria Music Center in Southern California. They changed their name to Feaver and 
                    played the 2011 Warped Tour. They also used the name The Narwhals before settling 
                    on Wallows in 2017, now without Mendenhall.
                In April 2017, the band released their first single under the Wallows moniker, "Pleaser". The song would eventually reach number two on the Spotify Global Viral 50 chart and number one on the KROQ Locals Only playlist. In May 2017, Wallows released a second single, "Sun Tan", and began playing live shows in the Los Angeles area, selling out The Roxy and the Troubadour. Their third single, "Uncomfortable", was released in September 2017.</p>

                <p>In November 2017, their song "Pulling Leaves off Trees" premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show. 
                    That month, the band also announced their first headlining North American tour that would run 
                    from January to March 2018. The tour started in San Francisco on January 24. 
                    In February 2018, the band announced that they had signed to Atlantic Records and were planning to 
                    release their major label debut EP, Spring, in April 2018. They also released a new single, 
                    "Pictures of Girls", their first on Atlantic. 
                    The song was chosen as a "Critical Cut" by SiriusXM Alt Nation.
                    Wallows ended their North American tour at South by Southwest in March 2018. Later in the month,
                     they released a second track from Spring titled "These Days".
                     The EP was released on April 6, 2018, by Atlantic Records and was produced by John Congleton.</p>

                <p>Wallows embarked on another leg of their Nothing Happens Tour in February 2020, for 15
                     additional stops. The band partnered with local non-profit charities in each of the 
                     cities in this leg of the tour such as Project Lazarus and the LGBT Center of Raleigh. 
                     Before each show, the band posted a list of donatable items for their attendees to bring 
                     (with the incentive of donating being a free Wallows pin) on their social media accounts, 
                     and were able to garner a plethora of items to donate after each show. In an interview with 
                     97X, a Tampa radio station, Minnette remarked that the nonprofit organization 
                     they partnered with in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Handy Inc., shared that Wallows fans
                     had brought an equivalent of five months' worth of supplies to the band's show.
