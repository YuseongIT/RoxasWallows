                    “Pleaser” is not a new song, nor is it underground. 

                    Yet, there is something so perfect about this song that has resonated with me ever since I first heard it. 
                    
                    This song was one that marked Wallows’ debut and made the band who they are today. Who would have thought back in 2017 that their debut single would be such a revolutionary moment for them in the years to follow? 
                    
                    The track is relatable in its entirety. About a guy who always finds himself biting his tongue and avoiding saying what’s on his mind to make sure other people are happy. Might sound familiar to those of us that are people-pleasers.
